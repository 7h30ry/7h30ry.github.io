Ok let's start and note that i won't give very detailed solution to some of the challenges

## Web

#### Anti Inspect

From the challenge name you can pretty much tell what this is about

Accessing the provided url works but the content doesn't seem to be rendered

Trying to open dev tools doesn't work because it prevents me from right clicking

I used curl to get the html source

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      const flag = "LITCTF{your_%cfOund_teh_fI@g_94932}";
      while (true)
        console.log(
          flag,
          "background-color: darkblue; color: white; font-style: italic; border: 5px solid hotpink; font-size: 2em;"
        );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

We can see the flag but that doesn't work when submitted perhaps due to `%c`

I just removed it and it worked

```
Flag: LITCTF{your_fOund_teh_fI@g_94932}
```

#### Jwt-1

Accessing the provided url shows this

If we click `Get Flag` we should get this

We can register here

Doing that we should have a valid credential that can get us logged in

Now that we are authentication I checked the cookie available and saw this jwt token

I decoded it using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54deac36-a15e-485e-a363-b4876ffc0578)

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

{
  "name": "pwner123",
  "admin": false
}
```

I just tried changed the `admin` key value to `true` to see if we could access the flag

Ok that works! And it's because it doesn't check for signature validation

```
Flag: LITCTF{o0ps_forg0r_To_v3rify_1re4DV9}
```
