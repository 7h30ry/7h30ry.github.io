Ok let's start and note that i won't give very detailed solution to some of the challenges

## Web

#### Anti Inspect

From the challenge name you can pretty much tell what this is about

Accessing the provided url works but the content doesn't seem to be rendered

Trying to open dev tools doesn't work because it prevents me from right clicking

I used curl to get the html source
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/904d328c-2f47-4412-95d8-12901fd7a426)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      const flag = "LITCTF{your_%cfOund_teh_fI@g_94932}";
      while (true)
        console.log(
          flag,
          "background-color: darkblue; color: white; font-style: italic; border: 5px solid hotpink; font-size: 2em;"
        );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

We can see the flag but that doesn't work when submitted perhaps due to `%c`

I just removed it and it worked

```
Flag: LITCTF{your_fOund_teh_fI@g_94932}
```

#### Jwt-1

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b63b3313-9dff-48ae-b41e-19f40ea8644c)

Accessing the provided url shows this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57cd4dee-e5d0-4150-983e-7813080748e8)

If we click `Get Flag` we should get this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71fddc60-7988-4f34-bc8f-ff79f0d45e32)

We can register here
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cfd1abb-55ee-44ca-9cbf-d22b9fe91fe3)

Doing that we should have a valid credential that can get us logged in

Now that we are authentication I checked the cookie available and saw this jwt token
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ad4601-6236-479f-81fd-f1736d11ac23)

I decoded it using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54deac36-a15e-485e-a363-b4876ffc0578)

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

{
  "name": "pwner123",
  "admin": false
}
```

I just tried changed the `admin` key value to `true` to see if we could access the flag
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bc05d64-8f23-49c5-bd5f-a2081e6f1750)

Ok that works! And it's because it doesn't check for signature validation

```
Flag: LITCTF{o0ps_forg0r_To_v3rify_1re4DV9}
```

#### Jwt-2
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ebdca89-9358-498d-9625-4e7cb50e2b00)

Ok same web app as the previous one but this time we are provided with the source code

I downloaded it and checking it shows this
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f03dea-d5b9-4a45-96c3-ea702ba04c8b)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/352fb263-1395-4c0e-b497-d8b4b1c5b14f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3384796-7952-426e-ab82-b70825a6d8d4)

First it imports some libraries

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2aa729a-27a4-459d-a134-90757f8963e5)

This is basically used for signing a jwt payload

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178a1758-30d2-4b1a-85c0-0cef81049fc8)

Starts the web app to listen on port 3000 or the port specified in the environment variable

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e72ba8-1af4-480f-8012-b6da13ca61b2)

Let's take a look at the routes now:

- Login: It's going to make sure it's a valid user then sign the username and setting admin to `false`
- 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9d73009-7a1f-408f-b95a-aa23a7540888)

- Signup: It's going to basically just add the user to the accounts array and sign the username and setting admin to `false`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b734aa-87b5-4eee-8122-f58b9fdf5753)

- Flag:  It's going to make sure the token is prevent then verifies the signature and make sure the username is set to admin meaning it's checking if `admin` is set to `true`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17606190-8267-432d-a6e3-5b03610ab8a2)

Because this verification does check the signature we can't go around this except via setting `admin` to `true`

We can easily do that because we know the jwt secret 

I wrote a script to generate a token for me
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00311e7d-0400-457f-86d0-86ee0acc517e)

That's pretty much just copy paste from the original server code with some modification

Running it i get a token and i used that to get the flag
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e38e36-d324-4501-8e3d-c29b3f24e85f)

```
Flag: LITCTF{v3rifyed_thI3_Tlme_1re4DV9}
```
