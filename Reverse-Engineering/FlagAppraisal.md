<h3> Flag Appraisal (MetaCTF July 2024) </h3>

Hi everyone, this is `0x1337` also known as `h4cky0u`

My github account was placed as spam so i'm currently waiting for Github support to fix it

So today I participated in the MetaCTF Monthly Challenge

And i'll be showing you how I solved the Reverse Engineering challenge called `Flag Appraisal`

I actually never got to submit the flag because I ended up solving it 3 minutes after the ctf ended due to skill issue and one thing is that the ctf runs for just 2 hours

So less talking and let's get to the main thing

We are given a x64 executable called `pawn_shop`

The binary is also stripped so that means we won't have function name 

I ran the binary to get an overview of what it does

It looks like the right input to solve this is going to be the flag

Time for some static analysis

Using Ghidra I decompiled the binary

Here's the entry function

```

void processEntry entry(undefined8 param_1,undefined8 param_2)

{
  undefined auStack_8 [8];
  
  __libc_start_main(FUN_0010128e,param_2,&stack0x00000008,0,0,param_1,auStack_8);
  do {
                    /* WARNING: Do nothing block with infinite loop */
  } while( true );
}
```

The first parameter passed into `__libc_start_main` is the `main` function so i renamed it

Moving on, we can check the main function decompilation and we should get this

The decompilation is pretty understandable but still i prefer to rename my variable cause it's way more better

```c

bool main(void)

{
  int fp;
  size_t n;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  char flag [104];
  long canary;
  
  canary = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  printf("Welcome to my Pawn Shop, go ahead and show me the flag you want appraised: ");
  fgets(flag,100,stdin);
  n = strcspn(flag,"\n");
  flag[n] = '\0';
  n = strlen(flag);
  mangle(flag,n & 0xffffffff);
  fp = strncmp(flag,&enc_flag,0x25);
  if (fp != 0) {
    puts("Unfortunately, your flag here looks to be a counterfeit.");
  }
  else {
    puts("Well good news, your flag looks to be authentic! Best I can do is $2.");
  }
  if (canary != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return fp != 0;
}
```

From this we can see it would
- Receive our input and store it in variable `flag`
- Remove any new line character (basically null terminating our input)
- Gets the length of our input which is stored in variable `n`
- Calls function `mangle()` passing our input and the length as the parameter
- Compares our mangeld input with the encrypted flag
- If the comparism if right that means we got the right flag input else we didn't get it
