### Web

#### Readme

We are given the web instance and a file sharing server which has a compressed archive

After downloading it I uncompressed it and got this

So that's the application source code

Opening it in VSCode I saw the flag in the `Dockerfile`

It seems this was unintended which lead to the release of `Readme2` i presume

In any case I got the flag

```
Flag: ictf{path_normalization_to_the_rescue}
```
